        /* Apple doc:
 There are two distinct types of comparison you can make between two objects in Swift. The first, equality (==), compares the contents of the objects. The second, identity (===), determines whether or not the constants or variables refer to the same object instance.
 
 Swift provides default implementations of the == and === operators and adopts the Equatable protocol for objects that derive from the NSObject class. The default implementation of the == operator invokes the isEqual: method, and the default implementation of the === operator checks pointer equality. You should not override the equality or identity operators for types imported from Objective-C.
 
 The base implementation of the isEqual: provided by the NSObject class is equivalent to an identity check by pointer equality. You can override isEqual: in a subclass to have Swift and Objective-C APIs determine equality based on the contents of objects rather than their identities. For more information about implementing comparison logic, see Object comparison in Cocoa Core Competencies.
